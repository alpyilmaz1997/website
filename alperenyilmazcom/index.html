						I live with the motto “Know something about everything, know everything about something.” as a person that has a multifarious taste. Before, I took a lesson and worked theatre, poetry, music, chess, coffee, cookery, and countless many works. In this, I learned much various knowledge from many various works. But after I had started to learn software I realized Software is the best job for me and I am continuing software life with enthusiasm. Nowadays, I am working as a software back-end developer.

							I was the president of the community in 2018-2019. Meanwhile, Two important events were held in addition to attending conferences. In 2018, we organized a coding contest called "Hackathon". Contestants tried to develop applications on one of the topics given in Hackathon for 30 hours. We, as organization leaders, took part in the audits and determination of the competition results. In 2019, we attended BİLMÖK (Computer Engineering Student Congress). This congress is Turkey's most prestigious student congress was held in 2018 Mugla. As a school, we participated in this congress with a crowded team.

							<h4><b>MODELING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTENCE GENES IN BACTERIA BY USING BIOINFORMATICS MOTHODS</b></h4>
							<h5 class="font-yellow" ><b>GRADUATION PROJECT THESIS</b></h5>
							<h6 class="font-lite-black margin-t-10">ABSTRACT</h6>
							<p class="margin-tb-30">
								Antibiotics are drugs used in treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacte- ria. As a result of its unconscious use by humans; antibiotic resistance has been formed in bacteria, hence antibiotics have lost their effects. In this research, bio- informatics studies on beta – lactam and vancomycin resistance genes have been carried out in order to help find solutions to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Furthermore, this research is intended to contribute to discovery of new drugs. Similarities of the resistance genes were considered for the purpose of creating a model. Two different modeling approaches were used - Hidden Markov Model and Convolutional Neural Network. Hidden Markov Model is a highly effective way of modeling data that comes in time series, while the Convolutional Neural Network is the most popular and effective method in image classification. MATLAB and Python programming languages were used for these methods. Main goal was to obtain an advanced method by comparing the results from two aforementioned modeling methods.

						I had fun hobbies in many different fields as a person who has a multifarious taste. I had taken part in various bands as a bass guitarist for approximately 4 years. I also gave private lessons to younger students in many fields such as Math, Turkish, as well as playing guitar. Since my elementary school, I have been being interested in written arts especially poetry and theatre with both as a performer and writer. Due to my interest in cookery, I took many cooking lessons and I try to expand my knowledge in the art of coffee.
